# Block Infection
Ever wanted a Vicious world eating block? \
this has it!
The reward is great but right now it's a W.I.P. \
More information comes later for now though I can also say that the infection block will not eat BlockEntities so chests or anything that can hold nbt so it's not that bad \
It also won't eat the infection resistant block (craftable with emeralds on the top bottom left and right with a diamond in the center)

Also sorry for the trash textures I'm bad at making them

I might forget to update this now that I think about it so check the commit history for more up-to-date information. \
But I'll try to make the README.md updated.

# TODO:
1. Add the structure
2. Find a way to stop the spread of the infection blocks but make it be able to spread again if another uncharged core block gets activated
