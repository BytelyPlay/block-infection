# Block Infection
Ever wanted a Vicious world eating block? \
this has it!
The reward is great but right now it's a W.I.P. \
More information comes later for now though I can also say that the infection block will not eat BlockEntities so chests or anything that can hold nbt so it's not that bad \
It also won't eat the infection resistant block (craftable with emeralds on the top bottom left and right with a diamond in the center)

Also sorry for the trash textures I'm bad at making them

I might forget to update this now that I think about it so check the commit history for more up-to-date information. \
But I'll try to make the README.md updated.

BACKUP BEFORE PLAYING!!!!

# How to play (I seriously even if only on the client, recommend JEI):
Optional first step: Get infection resistant blocks to protect your base just sorrounding your base with it or making the floor that can make your base resistant \
First step: craft 64 structure catalysts \
Second step: craft the structure maker \
Third step: right click the structure maker with the 64 structure catalysts \
Fourth step: right click the ground with the structure placer \
fifth step: find a way inside (not gonna spoil it but it is basically a vanilla glitch very well known...) \
Sixth step: right click the uncharged infection core \
Seventh step: wait until 8 random ticks happen on the uncharger grower (the block above the charged infection core) i will texture it to have the numbers on it (8 will just be a checkmark) \
Eighth step: right click the uncharger grower to get the uncharging staff \
Ninth and final step: right click the charged infection core with the uncharging staff to get the staff of unlimited power (this staff one shots anything and if it can't kill it, it'll despawn it but normally it should kill)

# TODO:
1. Get better textures and models (seriously if anyone can help i'm open...)
