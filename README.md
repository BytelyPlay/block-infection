# Block Infection
Ever wanted a Vicious world eating block? \
this has it!
The reward is great but right now it's a W.I.P. \
More information comes later for now though I can also say that the infection block will not eat BlockEntities so chests or anything that can hold nbt so it's not that bad \
It also won't eat the infection resistant block (craftable with emeralds on the top bottom left and right with a diamond in the center)

Also sorry for the trash textures I'm bad at making them

I might forget to update this now that I think about it so check the commit history for more up-to-date information. \
But I'll try to make the README.md updated.

I'm currently having issues with the crafting recipe(s)
Probably going to make a 9x9 but the problem is just that i feel like nothing i do will be balanced enough so i'll probably make it so you need to get like 210k of each ore or something stupidly high like that

# TODO:
1. ~~Add the structure~~ (not implemented if someone can implement this or i learn how to in the future i will)
2. make a way for users to make or get the uncharging staff and the uncharged core
